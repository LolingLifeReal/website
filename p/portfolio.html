  <h4 id="item">
      "<a href="https://CaptainLol.lolinglife.repl.co">Captain Lol</a>" was a discord bot project created just as to test and joke around but I realesed it to the public as of March or April and took it a bit serious and added updates regularly. One day I felt like I sort of mastered the basics and went on to working on a bit more advanced version but before I could I took a break cause of stress and discontinued the bot in June 2021.
